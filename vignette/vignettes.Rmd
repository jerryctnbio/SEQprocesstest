# 1 Background
 Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology is now widely used for biomedical research with various applications including identification of sequence variants from DNA or RNA sequences, and quantitation of RNA expression or DNA copy numbers. Previously, several softwares for NGS data processing pipelines have been released, however, rapid progress of the NGS applications and data processing methods urgently require prompt update of the pipelines such as the NCI genome data commons (GDC) used for processing the TCGA data. Recent clinical applications of NGS technology such as cell-free DNA, small RNA, cancer panel, and exosomal RNA sequencing data also require appropriate data processing pipelines. With this concern, we developed SEQprocess, a flexible and extendable framework that can provide NGS processing pipelines covering the GDC pipeline as well as the new data for clinical applications. 

\   
\   

# 2 Introduction
  Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology is now widely used for biomedical research fields, and is extensively being used  in the clinic (Kwon, et al., 2012). Applications of NGS technology include the identification of sequence variants of DNA or RNAs, and the quantitation of RNA abundances or DNA copy numbers. However, processing and analysis of NGS data still remain painful, because data processing procedure requires complex multiple steps and softwares. NGS data are generally processed by multiple processing steps including quality control, trimming, removal PCR duplication, sequence alignment, variant calling, and annotation, and each of the step requires different legacy softwares.  \ 
  To handle these complex processing steps, several softwares have been released. For example, NGS-pipe (Singer, et al., 2018) and NEAT (Schorderet, 2016) provide automated pipelines for NGS data analysis. Another tool systemPipeR also provides a NGS analysis workflow in R program that can be customized according to the various NGS applications such as whole-exome (WES), whole-genome (WGS) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) sequencing data (Backman and Girke, 2016). However, these tools do not handle the recently updated GDC pipelines which have been used in the processing of the TCGA data. Moreover, recent progress of clinical applications of the NGS data generate new platform data such as, cell free DNAs, exosomes, cancer panel, and single cells. These applications require analysis with customized setting for data quality control and processing. However, there is no comprehensive tools that can handle the recent clinical advancement in NGS technologies. \    
  With this concern, we developed a SEQprocess that can provide customizable NGS processing pipelines covering the GDC pipelines as well as the new data for clinical applications. SEQprocess is implemented in an R program to provide an automated and user-friendly interface. SEQprocess provides a flexible customization framework by modularizing the sequences of the NGS processing steps. SEQprocess also provides six pre-customized pipelines which are widely used as standards in NGS data processing that can be executed easily by non-experts such as biomedical scientists.

# 3 Getting Started 


## 3.1 System requirements


SEQprocess is developed as an R package which requires various R/Bioconductor libraries. Since the processed data are usually further analyzed for statistical assessment or visualization under R environment, R-compatible implementation of SEQprocess will facilitate the subsequent analyses for biological interpretation under R environment. The current version of SEQprocess supports Linux operating system, due to compatibility of the required softwares. Parallel computation on multi-core machines is also supported by using ‘parallel’ R package. \

### 3.52 Install external tools using Conda    
External software can also be installed using Conda:Bioconda. Bioconda is a channel for the Conda package manager specializing in bioinformatics software. All programs except the CRAN-R package, sequenza and ANNOVAR, can be installed using bioconda. We recommend installing the program using bioconda on Linux as follows :


(1) Install Miniconda by choosing the appropriate Python version and platform from the URL below. (Linux recommended)
https://conda.io/miniconda.html

(2) Continue installing using the following command line with the installed Miniconda bash script.
```
bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh (bash script-path)
```

(3) Connect the previously installed Conda with Bioconda, which manages the Bioinformatics tools.
```
conda config --add channels bioconda
```

(4) Use Conda and bioconda to install the required software.
```
conda install <fastqc, trim-galore, bwa...>
```

(5) See Conda and Bioconda for details.   
https://conda.io/docs/index.html    
https://bioconda.github.io/index.html
    
    
    
## 3.6 Pre-customized pipelines

Current version of SEQprocess provides six different pre-customized standard pipelines, including the pipelines for GDC processing and the newly adapted clinical applications for cell-free DNAs (cfDNA) and exosomal miRNAs (Fig. 1). These pipelines can be run by one-step command that can be executed easily by non-expert users. For WGS/WES, a GDC compatible pipeline of TrimGalore-BWA-Picard- VarScan2-VEP is implemented. We also implemented a popularly used standard Custom pipeline of TrimGalore-BWA-Picard-GATK–ANNOVAR. In addition, SEQprocess can estimate allele frequencies for each variant by calculating the sequence read depths of the mutated and wild-type sequences with a GATK function gatk.depthOFcoverage. For liquid biopsied cfDNA or targeted sequencing data such as cancer panel, an optimized pipeline excluding the step for removal duplicates is provided, because the sequence reads of the cfDNAs are usually have same sequences. For barcoded data (BarSeq), the step for removal duplicates is performed using the barcode information.    
For RNA-Seq data, a GDC pipeline STAR-Samtools-HTSeq pipeline is implemented. A popularly used standard pipeline Tuxedo (i.e.,Tophat2-Cufflinks) is also implemented. For miR-Seq data from exosomes, cells, or tissues, a pipeline of Cutadapt-BWA/bowtie2-HTSeq is implemented with optimized parameters.

# 4 System configuration

Configuration of the installed softwares and data can be managed simply by editing the `data/config.R` file. SEQprocess also supports parallel computation on multi-core machines by using ‘multicore’ R package. 

## 4.1 Path configuration

### 4.1.1 Softwares

If the required softwares are installed on a specific directory, you must set a 'program.dir' variable.

```
program.dir="/data/program"
```

Then, the executable file paths of softwares should be setted on this script file.
If you don't know the executable file path, type 'which fastqc' on the shell or system('which fastqc') on your R session.

```

```

You can also set the file paths using absolute path (e.g., `fastqc.path="/data/program/bin/fastqc"`).

### 4.1.2 Software parameters

The default parameters of the external programs are as follows.   



### 4.1.3 Reference files
The reference data used in the pipelines are pre-configured in the file 'data/config.R', which can be customized. If you need to modify it, correct the `config.R` .

```{r, eval=FALSE}

reference.dir="/data/pubdata"

# Reference FASTA (Version: GRCH38)
ref.fa=file.path(reference.dir,"[[path to referece directory]]/GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.201503031.fa")

```


### 4.1.4 Others

The index files used for each step are as follows.           
 - `fq1.idx` and `fq2.idx` are the index of the fastq file that loads the `qc`, `trim`, `bwa`, `tophat`, `star`, `bowtie2` input file.             
 - `bam.idx` is the index of the bam file that loads the `rmdu`, `realign`, `gatk`, `varscan`, `muse`, `mutect2`, `somaticsniper` input file.   
 - `vcf.idx` is the index of the vcf file that loads input file when annotating with `annovar`.              

```
fq1.idx=".1.fastq$|_R1.fastq$|.1_val_1.fq$|_1.fq$|.1_val_1.fq$"
fq2.idx=".2.fastq$|_R2.fastq$|.2_val_2.fq$|_2.fq$|.2_val_2.fq$"
bam.idx=".rg.od.bam$|.rmdu.bam$|.realign.bam$|.recal.bam$|.accepted.hits.bam$|.rg.order.bam$|.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam$|.sam$"
vcf.idx=".f.vcf$|_variants.vcf$|.snp.vcf$|.indel.vcf$"
```
If you want to reset the default settings for the index, you can modify it in `SEQprocess/data/config.R`.

## 6.1 ExpressionSet

 SEQprocess is implemented as a wrapper function in R package, which may facilitate the subsequent analysis under R environment. Furthermore, SEQprocess provides a function to transform the processed data into an ‘ExpressionSet’ R/bioconductor object, which is a popular data type for the subsequent analyses for biological interpretation. The processed data are transformed into a bioconductor-compatible data type i.e. ‘ExpressionSet’ which is popularly used for the subsequent analysis NGS data for biological interpretation. We provide these data type files with a filename extension of ‘.eSet’, ‘.vSet’, or ‘cSet’, for the expression, variants and DNA copy number data, respectively, which may serve a framework to facilitate the subsequent analyses. SEQprocess also provides the ability to convert an ExpressionSet to a SummarizedExperiment data format. Rows of SummarizedExperiment(R/bioconductor) data represent features(e.g. genes, isoforms, exons, proteins, etc...) and columns represent sample data. Like ExpressionSet, SummarizedExperiment is a data type that is easy to analyze after processing.

## 6.2 Report file

 Finally `report.mode` is a function used to combine the inferred samples into one unified table.
 
 In addition, SEQprocess provides a report that summarize the processing steps and visualized tables and plots for the processed results. The report file is automatically generated recording the workflows of the data processing steps, the options used in the processing, and the outcome results.
 
 
## 6.3 Log files
 
 Log files are also generated automatically that can be found in each output directory. Users can find error messages as well as the messages that record each processing step and running times. These will ensure the reproducibility of the data analysis.
 
 
 
# 7 Usage example
 SEQprocess package provides user the function, `SEQprocess`, to run DSEQ and RSEQ pipeline. This function is based on the arguments mentioned above and is run in Rscript.
